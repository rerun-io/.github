# Rerun: Visualization infrastructure for computer vision.

[Rerun](https://www.rerun.io/) is an SDK (in Python and Rust) for logging rich data like point clouds, images, and tensors. Those logs are then visualized live or recorded in the Rerun Viewer. 

It's basically print-f style debugging for computer vision and robotics. Over time, the goal is to build the modern visualization stack for real world AI.

We are a Rust shop, and we're using [`egui`](https://github.com/emilk/egui), [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu), and [`arrow2`](https://github.com/jorgecarleitao/arrow2) to create an app that is flexible, fast, and works on desktop as well as on the web.

At Rerun we believe that a healthy open source ecosystem is a net positive for the world. We will strive to make a lot of our work open source. We will also contribute to open source projects via issues, pull requests, and sponsorship. We track our contributions [here](https://github.com/rerun-io/opensource).
