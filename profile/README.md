# Rerun: Visualize Everything Fast.

[Rerun](https://www.rerun.io/) is an SDK for visualizing multimodal data that changes over time. Itâ€™s used by engineers and researchers in fields like computer vision, robotics, and gaming to verify, debug, and demo. It comes with C++, Python, and Rust bindings.

We are a Rust shop and are building on top of [`egui`](https://github.com/emilk/egui) and [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) to create an app that is flexible, fast, and works on desktop as well as on the web.

At Rerun we believe that a healthy open-source ecosystem is a net positive for the world. We strive to make a lot of our work open-source. We also contribute to open-source projects via issues, pull requests, and sponsorship. We track our contributions [here](https://github.com/rerun-io/opensource).
